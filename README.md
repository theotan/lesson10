# Unit testing sample git repo

To make the lesson run more smoothly, before class, create a git
repository with the following six files, in the folders shown:

- README.md
- Jenkinsfile
- vocab/go.mod
- vocab/vocab.go
- hypernyms/go.mod
- hypernyms/main.go

Make sure that your Jenkins installation can fetch from this repo
using SSH.

Create a pipeline for this repo.

There is a smoke test in the Jenkinsfile but no other tests.

During the class, we will add more files (including unit tests) into this
repository.
